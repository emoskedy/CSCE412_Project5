                <h3><p>Projects that I have made</p></h3>
                <h4><p>Developed a 2-player tic-tac-toe game</p></h4>
                <p>In my first year at Texas A&M University, I had the opportunity to work on a final project with my two other friends. 
                    Each of us had to make a game using Python then combine them into one file so the user can choose one of the three games. 
                    First, each of us created a hierarchy for the design of our program using a bottom-up approach. Then, we started working 
                    on implementing the design. Finally, we combined our codes into one single file and tested the program to make sure that 
                    it worked as intended; the program will ask the user to enter the game that they want to play or stop to quit the program. 
                    I made a game of tic-tac-toe on a 3x3 board and the board will be displayed before every move.<br><br>
                    I chose tic-tac-toe because it is basic for someone who is new to programming and also to practice my skills. 
                    During the project, I learned how to plot from matplotlib, numpy on my own and also learned different methods 
                    to make the code more efficient.

                <h3><p>Projects that I would like to make in the future</p></h3>
                <h4><p>A list about builds, guides, counters to champions in Wild Rift</p></h4>
                <p>I started playing League of Legends when I was eleven years old. Fascinated by the MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) 
                    gameplay and eye-catching graphics, as soon as I got back home from school, I went straight to my computer and started playing right away. 
                    Making a guide to champions in League would be a great project for me because I can practice HTML/CSS, Javascript skills while also learning 
                    more about the game that I have played for more than 9 years.</p>
                <div class="space">
                    <h4><p>Expand my tic-tac-toe project</p></h4>
                    <p>Another reason that I chose tic-tac-toe is because this project is easily expandable. That is, I can let the players choose their symbol, 
                        change the board size, play against AI, etc. Now that I have learned HTML/CSS and Javascript, I can improve the game by adding UI/graphics 
                        and many more.</p>
